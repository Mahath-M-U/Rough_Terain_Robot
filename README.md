technologies for several monitoring, surveillance and recovery operations. This paper presentsIn todayâ€™s world, we concentrate mainly on newly emerging  combination of two emerging technologies, which are Robotics and IoT. Most surveillance and monitoring robots does not have the ability to move on uneven surfaces and on slopes, but the rocker bogies have these features. While the present rocker bogies are remote controlled, it needs a human to be near it to control it. So our aim is to design a rocker bogie robot that can be controlled via IoT from a distance, which can be done using web page controlling. The control mechanism is provided with video transmission facility through high speed image transmission. The robot is fitted with a camera which captures the scene and transfer the images to the server on which the user can control and watch the live feed. We present the design of rocker bogie suspension and how to control it using commands in the further sections.
